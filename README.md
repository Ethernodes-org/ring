What is Ring?
----------------

Ring is a unique cryptocurrency with three dimensions of mining working symbiotically together.

Proof of Work uses our custom CPU-friendly hashing algorithm, Minotaur.

Hive Mining allows users to create on-chain dwarf agents who mine on their owner's behalf.

Finally, Proof of Pork allows users to play games right within the wallet. Their gameplay directy secures the blockchain, while earning rewards.

Ring features provably the widest initial distribution of a cryptocurrency ever, paying UTXOs from a total
of over 30 years of blockchain history.
